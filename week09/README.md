## Hospital

We will create GUI for Hospital software.
For this purpose we need three tables.
Patients, Doctors and Hospital stay.

Our users need to have the abilities to:

- list all patients
- list all doctors in the hospital

- add new patient
- add new doctor
- add hospital stay of a patient

- update patient's information
- update doctor's information
- update hospital's information

- delete patient
- delete doctor
- delete hospital stay

- list all patients of a doctor
- all sick patients group by their's sickness(injury)
- list all doctors and the diseases they treat

- show all patients from startdate_1 to startdate_2

### Example GUI

```python
You can use the following commands:
list_pacients
add_pacient
delete_pacient <pacient_id>
update_pacient <pacient_id>
command> :list_pacients
+----+----------+----------+-----+
| id |firstname | lastname | age |
+----+---------------------+-----+
| 1  | Rositsa  | Zlateva  |  22 |
| 2  |    Rado  | Rado     |  26 |
| 3  | Slavyana | Monkova  |  21 |
| 4  |   Kamen  | Kotsev   |  22 |
+----+----------+----------+-----+

```
